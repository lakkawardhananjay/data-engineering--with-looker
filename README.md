# Data Engineering Automation Using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

This project demonstrates a data engineering pipeline leveraging cloud-native services on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It outlines a generic architecture for ingesting, processing, transforming, and analyzing structured and semi-structured data at scale. The insights derived from this automated pipeline can be visualized using Looker or other business intelligence (BI) tools.

## Overview

In modern data-driven organizations, the volume and complexity of data are growing rapidly. Whether dealing with logs, application data, analytics events, or batch file uploads, efficient data engineering pipelines are critical for automated data ingestion, transformation, and analysis. This project presents a reference architecture using GCP services to build a scalable, reliable, and automated data engineering workflow.

## GCP Services Used

The following Google Cloud Platform services are utilized to build the automated data engineering pipeline:

### 1. Cloud Storage

* **Purpose:** Serves as the central data lake and landing zone for raw and processed data.
* **Usage:** External systems, applications, or data providers upload raw files (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) to Cloud Storage. It also stores processed and curated data for backup, further analysis, or archival purposes.

### 2. Cloud Functions

* **Purpose:** Provides lightweight, serverless compute for handling event-driven workflows.
* **Usage:** Automatically triggers data pipelines (e.g., Dataflow) when new files are uploaded to Cloud Storage. Can be used for metadata extraction, schema validation, or sending alerts based on incoming data conditions.

### 3. Cloud Composer

* **Purpose:** Orchestrates end-to-end data workflows using Apache Airflow.
* **Usage:** Manages Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for automating multi-step workflows, such as:

  * Detecting new data in Cloud Storage
  * Initiating Dataflow or BigQuery jobs
  * Managing dependencies and retries
  * Scheduling periodic batch jobs and aggregations
  * Sending pipeline monitoring alerts

### 4. Dataflow

* **Purpose:** Fully-managed service for batch and stream data processing using Apache Beam.
* **Usage:** Performs scalable ETL and ELT tasks such as:

  * **Data Validation:** Cleansing, deduplication, and schema enforcement
  * **Data Transformation:** Enriching, normalizing, and aggregating data
  * **Streaming Pipelines:** Ingesting real-time data feeds (e.g., Pub/Sub)
  * **Batch Pipelines:** Processing historical data stored in Cloud Storage

### 5. BigQuery

* **Purpose:** Cloud-native, serverless data warehouse for fast and cost-effective analytics.
* **Usage:** Acts as the central analytics layer where curated data is loaded from Dataflow. It enables:

  * **Ad-hoc SQL Analysis:** Explore and query large datasets with SQL
  * **Data Modeling:** Build data marts and materialized views
  * **BI Integration:** Connect with Looker or other BI tools for dashboards and reports
  * **Machine Learning:** Use BigQuery ML or integrate with Vertex AI for advanced analytics

## Usage

1. **Data Ingestion:** External systems upload raw data files into Cloud Storage. This can be scheduled drops (e.g., nightly exports) or real-time uploads.
2. **Event Triggering:** Cloud Functions detect file arrivals and trigger corresponding Dataflow jobs for preprocessing.
3. **Workflow Orchestration:** Cloud Composer DAGs manage pipeline executionâ€”coordinating stages like file validation, transformation, data loading, and quality checks.
4. **Data Processing:** Dataflow pipelines clean, transform, and enrich the raw data and output the curated dataset to Cloud Storage or directly into BigQuery.
5. **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Analysts and stakeholders can run SQL queries in BigQuery or use Looker to create dynamic dashboards, reports, and data models based on the processed data.
